### About me and this profile

Linux is one of my core passions, since 1998 when I installed it on my first computer.

On 2009 I made a career shift to web development and could turn entirely to the Linux ecosystem 24/7 (previously I was a MS-DOS / Windows desktop developer with Clipper / Delphi).

Since that big shift I've been focusing on backend development with Python, Django, Flask and infrastructure automation with Ansible.


## What is available here

I code and write A LOT on my spare time. My priorities are always changing, as I am curious and like tinkering with code and ricing my development workflow.

So, here's a summary:

- **cookiecutters** for python scripts, flask and django.

- **python/django/flask projects**: Some I actively work on, and others not but are here so that they can be used as a reference for myself and anyone interested.

- [my custom development workflow](https://github.com/tiagoprn/dot_files): neovim, tmux and bspwm customization using lua and shellscripts - 2 languages I also have fun working with.

- [infrastructure automation scripts, configuration, etc](https://github.com/tiagoprn/devops).

Feel free to browse any of them. If you want to ask anything, feel free to open a issue. I am also open to pull requests. ;)


## What I am learning

You can check that on [writeloop](https://writeloop.dev) - which is my second brain that is part of my development workflow and so, fully automated.
