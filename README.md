On 1998 I installed Linux on my first computer and it gave me the insight of the endless possibilities that an open source ecosystem could provide.

On 2009 I made a career shift to web development and started to code on the Linux ecosystem (previously I was a MS-DOS/Windows desktop developer with Clipper/Delphi).

Since then I've been focusing on **backend development with Python, Django, Flask and infrastructure automation** using shell scripts, Makefiles, Docker and Ansible.


## Projects available here

I code and write A LOT on my spare time. My priorities are always changing, as I am curious and like tinkering with code and ricing my development workflow. Here's a summary:

- **cookiecutters** for python scripts, flask and django.

- **python/django/flask projects**: Some I actively work on, and others not but are here so that they can be used as a reference for myself and anyone interested.

- [my custom development workflow](https://github.com/tiagoprn/pde.nvim): neovim customization using custom lua code and some shellscripts - 2 languages I also have fun working with.

- [infrastructure automation scripts, configuration, etc](https://github.com/tiagoprn/devops).

Feel free to browse any of them. **If you want to ask anything, go ahead and open an issue**. I also accept pull requests. ;)


## What I am learning

You can check that on [writeloop](https://writeloop.dev) - which is my second brain that is part of my development workflow and is fully automated.
